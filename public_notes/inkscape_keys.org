* How to read this

- *Control + z* means press *Control* and *z* at the same time.
- *F7* /and/ *Shift + click* means *F7* , contextual action then *Shift + click*.

* Movements
** Panning the canvas
- ~Control + arrows~ or ~mouse wheel~ :: scroll
- ~Shift + mouse wheel~ :: scroll horizontally
- ~Control + b~ :: toggle scrollbars
** Zooming
- ~-~ or ~=~ :: zoom
- ~Control + mouse wheel~ :: zoom
- ~`~ :: previous zoom
- ~Shift + `~ :: next zoom
** Documents
- ~Control + n~ :: new document
- ~Control + M + n~ :: new from template
- ~Control + o~ :: open document
- ~Control + s~ :: save document
- ~Control + Shift + s~ :: save as
- ~Control + Tab~ :: other window
* Shapes
- ~F2~ :: paths and notes (round stuff)
- ~F4~ :: rectangle. ~Control + click~ makes it regular, ~Shift + click~ uses stating pointing as the center.
- ~F5~ :: ellipses and arcs
- ~F6~ :: freehand lines
- ~F7~ ::  dropper (color picker)
- ~F8~ :: text objets
- ~Control + z~ :: undo
- ~Control + Shift + z~ :: redo
** Star and Polygons
- ~*~ :: stars and polygons
- ~Shift + drag~  :: round
- ~Shift + click~ :: remove rounding
** Spirals
- ~F9~ :: spirals
- ~Control + drag~ :: snap to 15 degree increments
*** Outer handle
- ~Shift + drag~ :: scale/rotate around center.
- ~Alt + drag~ :: lock radius while rollin
*** Inner Handle
- ~Alt + drag vertically~ :: converge/diverge.
- ~Alt + click~ :: reset divergence.
- ~Shift + click~ :: move inner handle to the center.
g/unrolling

** Ellipses
- ~F2~ and ~drag on the right handle~ :: slice
* Transforming
** Moving, scaling, rotating
*** Basic
- ~F1~ or ~SPC~ :: select tool
*** Single Click
- ~Control~ (dragging the object) :: restrict movement to horizontal and vertical
- ~Control~ (dragging a handle) :: preserve ratio
*** Double Click
- ~Control~ (dragging a corner handle) :: rotate by 15 degrees. The cross is the center.
- ~Control~ (dragging a non-corner hander) :: skew by 15 degrees.
** Transforming by keys
*** Basic
- ~arrows~ :: move by 2px
- ~<~ and ~>~ :: scale by 2px
- ~[~ and ~]~ :: rotate 15°
- ~Shift~ :: increase movement and scale by 10 times
- ~Control + Shift + c~  :: convert shape to path
*** Control
- ~Control~ :: makes rotation 90°
- ~Control + >~ :: scale up 200%
- ~Control + <~ :: scale down 50%
*** Meta
- ~Alt + <~ or ~Alt + >~ :: scale by one *screen* pixel
- ~Alt + [~ or ~Alt + ]~ :: rotates by one screen pixel
- ~Alt + arrows~ :: move by one screen pixel
* Selections
** Multiple Selections
- ~Shift + click~ or ~drag around~ :: select multiple objects
- ~Control + a~ :: selects all objects in the current layer
** Grouping

A group behaves as a single object when you drag or transform it. ~Ctrl + u~ only ungroups the top level, you'll need to use it repeatedly for recursive ungroup.

- ~Control + g~ (with the objects selected) :: create a group
- ~Control + u~ or ~Control + Shift + g~ (with the objects selected) :: ungroup one or more groups
- ~Control + click~ :: edit object from a group
- ~Control + Shift + click~ :: edit multiple objects from a group
** Z-order

Tells which objects are on top and which are on the bottom.

- ~PgUp~ :: raise object by one level
- ~PgDn~ :: bury object by one level
- ~Home~ :: raise object to the very top
- ~End~ :: bury object to the very bottom
- ~Tab~ :: cycles bottom-up
- ~Shift + tab~ :: cycles top-down
** Selecting under and dragging selected
- ~Alt + click~ :: cycles top to bottom
- ~Alt + drag~ :: after previous. Drag the currently selected object, not the visible one.
** Selecting similar objects

If you want to select all the blue squares, first select one of the blue squares and go run ~Fill Color~. All the objects with a fill color the same shade of blue are now selected.

- ~M-e m~ :: select same menu
* Editing
** Fill and Stroke
- ~Control + Shift + k~ :: color swatch dialog
- ~Control + Shift + f~ :: fill and stroke
- ~Control + F1~ :: gradient tool
- ~F7~ and ~click~ ::  dropper (color picker), assign color to object fill
- ~F7~ and ~Shift + click~ :: dropper (color picker), assign color to object stroke

- *Fill* :: lets you edit the interior of the selected object(s).
- Stroke paint :: can remove the stroke (outline) of the object, assign a color or transparency to it.
- Stroke styles :: lets you set the width and other parameters of the stroke.
** Duplication and alignment
- ~Control + d~ :: duplicate object
- ~Control + Shift + a~ :: align and distribute dialog
